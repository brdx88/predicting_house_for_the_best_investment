# Predicting House Price for the Best Investment
Home is a primary basic need, everyone needs a house for shelter every day. However, for those who have their needs met, some people use the money to invest. One of the investment instruments is property, especially houses. This dataset provides information on the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, conditions, views, building area, land area, basement area, and of course prices. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).


## Problems
Many people want to start investing but don't know where to invest. Property is one of them. But the question is, what kind of house is roughly compatible with the money owned by investors? Is asking a property agent a solution? Truth be told, real estate agents will only convince you to buy their wares. Not convincing you to invest. When it comes to investing, you need to know what specifications the market will be interested in. You don't buy just to be deposited, do you?

## Goals
Before you spend a lot of money on investing, you should consider the specifications first rather than listening to the empty sentences of real estate agents. High risk high return, but investing is about minimize risks to increase the chances of getting big returns constantly. We will make Machine Learning model to predict house prices so that at least we know the market price in circulation with specifications that match the price.
